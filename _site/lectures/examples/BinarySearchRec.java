 * Binary Search
 * Author:  Eric Fouh
 * 
 * Description:
 * Use recursive binary search to find the position of an 
 * element (the key) in a sorted array.
 * Binary search begins by examining the value in 
 * the middle position of the array.
 * - If the key is less than the middle element, 
 *   search the key in the first half of the array.
 * - If the key is equal to the middle element, 
 *   the search ends with a match. The position is 
 *   returned
 * - If the key is greater than the middle element, 
 *   search the key in the second half of the array.
 * 
 * Compilation:  javac BinarySearch.java
 * Execution:    java BinarySearch
 *     
 * Output: the position of an element in a sorted array
 *         or -1 if the element is not in the array
 * 
 * Program Arguments:  none
