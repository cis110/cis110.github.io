    <h3>TA/Mentor Code of Conduct</h3>

    <p>All course staff are expected to complete all required duties and
    adhere to the TA code of conduct.  Remember, this is a job: if you
    don't get your work done, your timesheets may be rejected (since
    you haven't done your job), you may not be offered a position in
    subsequent semesters, and we may refuse to write you a letter of
    recommendation.</p>

    <p>Ethical breaches that harm the integrity of the course are
    likely to result in <em>immediate dismissal from the course
    staff</em> and <em>referral to the Office of Student Conduct</em>.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li> Do not reveal confidential information (including reference implementations and grading rubrics).</li>
      <li> Do not store confidential information (including any
        records that identify students) in private e-mail accounts or
        cloud storage.  For FERPA compliance, you must use your UPenn
        e-mail and FERPA-compliant partners (Piazza and
        Google@SEAS/SAS/Wharton).</li>
      <li> Do not give help privately over e-mail.  Instead, direct
        students to piazza (using a private thread if necessary).  If
        e-mail is necessary, cc or bcc cis110@cis.  This rule is meant
        more than anything to protect you.  It allows us to intervene
        early to deal with problems when necessary, and avoids
        unpleasant surprises.  For example, we have seem private
        e-mail threads with TAs show up in OSC investigations, and
        that can get very messy for you as well as for us.  If we're
        in the loop, we can head this off.</li>
      <li> <em>Never give help outside the structures of the
        course!</em>  This includes informally helping friends or
        students in your dorm as well as private tutoring (paid or
        unpaid) on the side.  This is an extremely serious conflict of
        interest and may get you fired and/or referred to the OSC.  If
        you have time to dedicate to giving help, answer piazza posts
        or work extra office hours (if there is demand).  This rule
        also protects the separation between your work and private
        lives: if students corner you in your dorm to ask question,
        you may simply answer, <b>"I'm not allowed to help you outside
        of office hours/piazza."</b></li>
      <li> <em>Do not meet privately with students without our
        knowledge.</em>  This is also an extremely serious conflict of
        interest that may get you fired and/or referred to the OSC.
        We routinely ask TAs to meet individually with <b>their
        own</b> students to help them catch up; such meetings must
        always be reported on your timesheets.  It is extremely
        unusual for us to ask a TA or mentor to meet privately with a
        student from a different recitation, and you should never do
        so without our permission.

        <p> It may be appropriate for you to reach out to struggling
          students <b>in your own recitation</b> and offer to meet
          with them.  If you do that, you must inform us immediately.
          The easiest way to do this is to cc or bcc us on your
          e-mail.</p></li>
      <li> Do not contradict official course policy, homework
        instructions, coding style guidelines, etc.  You are
        responsible for knowing, following, and supporting everything
        we announce to students, and following all instructions we
        give in announcements to you or in staff meeting.  This is
        pretty dictatorial, but you've probably had a class where the
        TAs and instructors were not in step and know how much trouble
        that can cause.</li>
      <li> Complete all duties in a timely manner.  These duties may
        include (but are not necessarily limited to):
        <ul>
          <li> grading;</li>
          <li> recording grades, attendance, <em>and pariticpation</em>;</li>
          <li> planning recitation;</li>
          <li> teaching recitation;</li>
          <li> holding office hours;</li>
          <li> completing assignments by the TA deadline;</li>
          <li> monitoring piazza; </li>
          <li> attending staff meeting, TA training, and lecture;
          <li> completing timesheets</li>
        </ul>
        <em>Make a weekly checklist for yourself of your duties.</em>
        Failure to complete any of your duties will result in your
        timesheets being held until you are completely caught up, and
        may result in timesheets being rejected.</li><br><br>
      <li> Keep in close contact with your co-TA to plan your
        recitation and to plan ahead together for busy weeks.  It is
        your joint responsibility to get your grading and office hours
        done, no matter how busy are otherwise.  It is also your joint
        responsibility to plan out how you will run your recitation
        effectively together.  We consistently see a difference in
        student evaluations between pairs of TAs that meet ahead of
        each recitation to plan it in detail and pairs (even
        experienced pairs) that "wing it."</li>
      <li> Do your Piazza shifts.  This means reading and answering
        all questions frequently throughout the day, and knowing what
        questions have been asked so you refer to existing answers
        rather than repeating them.  It is not Scott's job to do this
        alone!</li>
      <li> Promptly report any time conflicts or situations that may
        prevent you from getting work done on time to us, to the head
        TAs, and to your partner.  This does not relieve you of your
        responsibilities, but it does help us find a way to make sure
        they are met.</li>
      <li> Promptly report any kudos or concerns about other members
        of the course staff, including your partner, to the
        instructors or head TAs.  We will not immediately fire (or
        promote) anyone just because you tell us something, but we can
        solve many issues early if we know about them.  For instance,
        if we learn early that a member of the course staff is
        frequently missing or tardy to office hours, we may be able
        help that person get back on track.  If we only learn
        belatedly after the problem has gotten serious, we may have no
        alternative but to not re-hire them.</li>
      <li> Submit all homeworks by the TA deadline.  You may work
        together with other TAs on the assignments (with proper credit
        in your readme), but you must complete each assignment from
        scratch.  You may not use the reference implementation, and
        you may not resubmit your version from a previous semester.
        Assignments change in subtle ways each semester, and you must
        know the current version before it goes out to students.</li>
    </ul>
