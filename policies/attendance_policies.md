### Attendance

Attendance is mandatory for both lectures and recitations and is a non-trivial portion of your grade in CIS 110.

---
Lecture attendance
: Lecture attendance is required and is part of your grade. Frequently missing lecture, arriving late, leaving early, or failing to participate in polls may affect your course grade. Since some of you will be unable to attend lecture at the time it is recorded, you may watch recorded lectures in place of attending. However, we will be tracking lecture attendance and record viewing so make sure you do one or the other!.

---
Missing lecture
: Lectures are recorded, so even if you cannot attend lecture in person we expect you to watch it after the fact.

---
Lecture recordings
: Slides and associated textbook readings are normally posted on the syllabus page before class. The lecture recordings are posted about an hour after lecture. The list of recordings is linked from the Syllabus page.

### Polls

CIS 110 uses web-based polling in lecture. Your participation in these polls will count as part of your grade. In most or all cases, polls will be used to start discussions rather than end them. That means we want you to think about the question, but we normally won't grade you on correctness. In fact, for most quizzes, we won't even look up what you answered.

---
Registering for polls
: For running in-class polls, we use Poll Everywhere. In order for us to track your poll participation, you will need to [sign up for a Poll Everywhere account](https://www.polleverywhere.com/signup?arlt=signupbutton&usrc=signup_button). You **must** sign up using your Penn email in order for us to properly track your attendance.

---
Participating in a poll for a friend
: Answering polls for another student so they appear to be present, or having another student poll for you when you are absent, is a **serious violation of course policy**. All students involved will normally be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and will have implications for all students' grades.

---
Participating in a poll remotely
: You cannot participate in polls remotely. Any poll submissions from outside of the classroom will not count towards attendance.
