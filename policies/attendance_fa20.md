### Attendance - Fall 2020 Modifications

Typically, attendance is mandatory for both lectures and recitations and is a non-trivial portion of your grade in CIS 110. In light of the new setup of courses, however, we will be adopting a revised attendance policy for CIS 110 to account for our many students who either cannot or will not be attending any form of the course in person. Please be patient as we finalize this policy.
