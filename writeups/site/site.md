# CIS 110 Website

## Brief Intro

All websites can be broadly divided into two sets: **static** sites and **dynamic** sites. A static site will deliver the same content to every user whereas a dynamic site is in some way personalized. Twitter, for example, is a **dynamic** site - you have a custom feed curated for your account, and in the backend, there is a database that is holding the info that was just loaded onto your screen. Something like cis110.com is a static site - if you go to the homepage, it will look the same to you as it does to everyone else. As you navigate through a static site, you're just traversing a tree of html files that are loaded into your browser as you go. Because cis110.com is a static site, this guide will be focused on the following skills and tools:

- Our modern solution for our website, including development and deployment
- Day to day edits for the site including
  - Releasing homework
  - Modifying the syllabus
  - Adding staff info
- Setting up a new semester

Once comfortable with the information in this guide, you should be able to edit the website yourself, as well as be prepared to launch the next semester's site. We're going to skip over what it used to be like to develop websites in the past and just jump right into modern approaches to keep this guide to a bearable length, but we may put together an introduction to web development that will go over writing HTML, and take the time to discuss dynamic site creation as well.

## Jekyll: A Static Site Generator

Jekyll is the software we use to develop our website. Jekyll is a static site generator, and is [one of many](https://jamstack.org/generators/) that exist.

NOTE: This is a WIP. More to come.
