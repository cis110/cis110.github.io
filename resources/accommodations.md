### Formal and Informal Accomodations

We are committed to assisting students requiring special accommodations for circumstances that are registered with the [Office of Student Disability Services (SDS)](https://www.vpul.upenn.edu/lrc/sds/). The University of Pennsylvania provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities who have self-identified and been approved by SDS. Students need to make arrangements with SDS. If you have not yet contacted SDS and would like to request accommodations or have questions, you can make an appointment by calling SDS at 215-573-9235. The office is located in the Weingarten Learning Resources Center at Stouffer Commons 3702 Spruce Street, Suite 300. All services are confidential. If you are not formally registered with SDS and experience anxiety, depression, learning disabilities or other issues that affect your ability to fully participate and learn in this class, you are encouraged to check-in with a course instructor.
