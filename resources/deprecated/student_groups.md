### Engineering and Computer Science Groups for Specific Interests and Disciplines

#### [National Society of Black Engineers - NSBE](https://www.dolphin.upenn.edu/nsbe/)

NSBE aims to increase the number of culturally responsible black engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community. Although our primary goals revolve around academic excellence, professional development, and community service, we hold many social events that foster and strengthen our tight-knit community. If you are looking to be a part of a family away from home, join ours. You don't have to be an engineer or black. We accept and love everyone-- all majors and races.

#### [Out in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics - oSTEM](https://www.facebook.com/ostematpenn/)

oSTEM at Penn is a chapter of Out in Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics (oSTEM), the national student society dedicated to increasing participation of people who identify with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or ally (LGBTQA) communities in disciplines related to science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).

#### [Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers - SHPE](https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~shpe/dynamic/wordpress/)

We strive to provide Hispanic engineering students at the University of Pennsylvania with opportunities that will improve their academic, leadership, and professional abilities.  We host a number of community service, networking, and social events. Penn SHPE develops programs according to the Five SHPE Pillars:  Academics, Community Outreach, Chapter Development, Leadership Development, and Professional Development.

The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) is a non-profit service organization aimed at informing the community of the qualifications and achievements of women engineers. Its mission is to stimulate women to achieve their full potential in their careers as engineers and as leaders, to expand the image of the engineering profession as a positive force in improving the quality of life, and to demonstrate the value of diversity.

#### [Women in Computer Science - WiCS](https://wics.cis.upenn.edu/)

The University of Pennsylvania Women in Computer Science student organization aims to foster a community for women in tech at Penn â€“ including Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Computational Biology, Digital Media Design and Networked and Social Systems Engineering. Our purpose is to support and promote women in CS by encouraging discussion and raising awareness regarding issues surrounding women in computer science.
