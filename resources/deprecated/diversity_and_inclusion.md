### Diversity and Inclusion

We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts,perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Penn records, please let us know!
- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us.
- As a participant in course discussions, office hours, and recitations, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.

If you ever are struggling and just need someone to talk to, feel free to stop by office hours, or to reach out to an instructor and we can arrange a private meeting with an assurance of full confidentiality.
