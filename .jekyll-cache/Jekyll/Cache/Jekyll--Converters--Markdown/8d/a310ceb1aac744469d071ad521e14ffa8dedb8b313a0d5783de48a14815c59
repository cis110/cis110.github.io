    <p><strong>The professor reserves the right to adjust grading policies. Final grade determinations are made by the professor.</strong></p>

  <dt>Homework Grades</dt>
  <dd>We use points on homework as a mechanism to provide feedback. You should be learning from doing the assignments and also from the feedback on them, which means <strong>homework grades may well be lower than you are used to. Donâ€™t worry!</strong> In past semesters 30%-40% of CIS 110 students have received an A- or better in the course, and we expect this semester to be similar.</dd>

<dl>
  <dt>Exam Grades</dt>
  <dd>We publish raw exam grades and do not curve exams. Instead, we curve the class at the end of the semester if necessary. CIS 110 exams are usually challenging, so a low raw score is not cause for panic.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<dl>
  <dt>Check-in Quizzes</dt>
  <dd>These quizzes are meant to help you gauge your understanding of the material presented in the weekly short Lecture videos. You will be graded on correctness, but you will be able to see which questions you got wrong and re-submit until you get them all right.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<dl>
  <dt>Making up work</dt>
  <dd>Grades are based on your performance on work completed during the semester in accordance with course policies. It is not possible to make up work in order to improve your grade or compensate for violations of course policy.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Incompletes, with permission to complete coursework after the semester ends, will be granted only in verifiable cases of serious, extended illness or similar extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<hr />
<dl>
  <dt>Grounds for failure</dt>
  <dd>A serious lack of effort may be grounds for failure in the course. If you find yourself in any of the situations below, you should meet with an instructor promptly to discuss your situation:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>Numerous missed assignments or substantially blank assignments.</li>
  <li>Academic dishonesty (see the collaboration tab). If you believe you may have violated the collaboration policy, you are encouraged to explain what happened to the instructor. Even if your actions constitute a serious violation, the sanctions are likely to be considerably less if you turn yourself in.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<dl>
  <dt>Conversion to letter grades</dt>
  <dd>All graded work is converted to a percentage grade between 0% and 100%. Homeworks are converted by dividing your score by 50 (the maximum number of points per assignment). Here is approximately how the percentage grades will map to final letter grades:</dd>
</dl>

<ul>
  <li>97% &lt;= A+ (4.0)</li>
  <li>93% &lt;= A (4.0)</li>
  <li>90% &lt;= A- (3.7)</li>
  <li>87% &lt;= B+ (3.3)</li>
  <li>83% &lt;= B (3.0)</li>
  <li>80% &lt;= B- (2.7)</li>
  <li>77% &lt;= C+ (2.3)</li>
  <li>73% &lt;= C (2.0)</li>
  <li>70% &lt;= C- (1.7)</li>
  <li>67% &lt;= D+ (1.3)</li>
  <li>63% &lt;= D (1.0)</li>
  <li>&lt; 63% F (0.0)</li>
</ul>
