<p>Typically, attendance is mandatory for both lectures and recitations and is a non-trivial portion of your grade in CIS 110. Due to the online format for the Spring 2021 semester, however, we will be adopting a revised attendance policy for CIS 110 to account for our many students who either cannot or will not be attending any form of the course synchronously:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attendance is not tracked or graded</li>
  <li>There is no recitation component to the course for Spring 2021</li>
  <li>It is expected that students will attend the lectures</li>
  <li>Weekly quizzes take the place of tracked attendance in order to make sure that students are keeping pace with the course materials</li>
</ul>
