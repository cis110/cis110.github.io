<h3 id="diversity-and-inclusion">Diversity and Inclusion</h3>

<p>We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts,perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Penn records, please let us know!</li>
  <li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please donâ€™t hesitate to come and talk with us.</li>
  <li>As a participant in course discussions, office hours, and recitations, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you ever are struggling and just need someone to talk to, feel free to stop by office hours, or to reach out to an instructor and we can arrange a private meeting with an assurance of full confidentiality.</p>
